    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta al forno (lit. 'pasta to the oven', i.e. 'baked pasta') or timballo di pasta is a typical dish of Italian cuisine, made of (usually short) pasta covered with béchamel sauce, tomato sauce and cheese, and cooked in the oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>4 skinless chicken fillets, chopped into 2cm pieces</li> 
       <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
       <li>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</li>
       <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</li>
       <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
       <li>250mls stock or water</li>
       <li>2 tbsp. tomato purée</li>
       <li>2 tbsp. Crème fraîche</li>
       <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
       <li>2 tbsp. chopped fresh basil, plus leaves to garnish</li>
       <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <li>300g pasta –penne, macaroni , tagliatelle or linguini</li>
       <li>125g mozzarella cheese, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a little oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for about for 5 minutes until just softened.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat, add a little more oil and then add the chicken. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, water, tomato purée, crème fraîche, sugar and basil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high. Drain the pasta and stir into the chicken and tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a shallow heatproof dish and sprinkle over the chopped mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Place under the grill until the cheese is golden and bubbling – this should take about 5 minutes. Garnish with basil leaves and serve with a baby kale salad.</li>
    </ol>
