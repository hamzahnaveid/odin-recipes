    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coddle is an Irish dish which is often made to use up leftovers.</p>
    <p>It most commonly consists of layers of roughly sliced pork sausages and rashers (thinly sliced, somewhat-fatty back bacon) with chunky potatoes, sliced onion, salt, pepper, and herbs. Traditionally, it can also include barley.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small knob of butter or lard</li>
        <li>8 thick rashers unsmoked bacon</li>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>A few thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>6-8 pork sausages</li>
        <li>About 800g waxy potatoes</li>
        <li>800ml-1 litre ham or chicken stock</li>
        <li>Salt and black or white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the fat in a large pot for which you have a lid on a medium-high heat, then fry the bacon until the fat runs and it just starts to brown, but before the bacon turns crisp. Lift out the bacon, keeping as much fat in the pan as possible, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium-low, then fry the onions, stirring regularly, until soft, but without letting them take on too much colour apart from that from the bacon fat. Stir in the thyme, if using, and season with pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the sausages, bacon and potatoes and pour over the liquid – use more if you’d prefer a brothier dish.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, then cover, turn down the heat and cook for about 45 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through.</li>
        <li>Taste the gravy, season if necessary, then sprinkle with parsley, if using, and serve with cabbage and brown, Worcestershire or similar sauce.</li>
    </ol>
